# CarrIOTA Nelson Monitor

This is a small http server that monitors the Nelson instance and outputs the status as a web page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A Nelson instance should be running locally on your machine using the default api port 18600.

### Installing

Globally install nelson.mon

```
npm install -g nelson.mon
```

And run it

```
nelson.mon
```

Now open  ```http://localhost:3000``` to see the monitor. Currently the api and http ports are not configurable.

Work in progress.
